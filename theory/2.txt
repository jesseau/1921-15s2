Section 2

Question 1
Consider a data type which stores information about m * m square matrices.

a) Define a struct (or typedef struct) which can hold information about a square matrix of size m * m. Assume the matrix data comprises of integers.
b) Write a corresponding function newMatrix which creates this matrix and returns it.
c) Write a freeMatrix function which frees any memory allocated to the matrix.
d) Assume I have made a 4 * 4 matrix with your newMatrix function. How would I change the second row, second column to an arbitrary integer, like 6?

Hint: read the entire question before thinking about how to approach the problem.

Question 2
Consider the following binary search tree for parts (a) to (c):

      9
     / \
    /   \
   /     \
  5      22
 / \     / \
1   8   /   \
 \     16   25
  4     \
        20

a) What is the height of the tree?
b) Give the tree in preorder or prefix order.
c) Give the tree in postorder or postfix order, AFTER the root node, 9, is deleted.

d) Given a list of numbers 9 5 22 1 8, show each step of a selection sort, also showing the number of comparisons and swaps which occurred at each step. Use the table as a template:

Numbers | Comparisons | Swaps
--------+-------------+------
your    | data        | here

etc.
